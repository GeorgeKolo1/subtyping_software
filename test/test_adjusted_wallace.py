def test_adjusted_wallace():
    '''Function that tests the adjusted wallace function
    
    This function tests the adjusted wallace function by using test data provided in the test_data_folder directory. It runs the adjusted wallace coefficient on two subtyping method classifications
    and asserts whether the adjusted wallace coefficient is between 0 and 1, and that it is equal to the known correct value of the output of the adjusted wallace coefficient when run using other means

    Args:

    Returns:
        A pytest assert statement to ensure that the test data is running correctly and the adjusted wallace coefficient is behaving as expected
